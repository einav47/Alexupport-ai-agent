Input (Selected product ID: B000SSYY88-Norpro Stainless Steel Cheese Plane/Slicer):
is this good for soft cheese?

Output:
Based on customer reviews, this product is not highly effective for soft cheeses. Several users reported that it struggles with soft cheeses like cream cheese and Brie, tending to clog, make a mess, or curl the cheese rather than provide clean slices. Some reviewers suggested chilling soft cheese and dipping the slicer in water before use, which might improve performance, but overall, most agree it works best on firm, hard, or medium cheeses. In terms of durability, the slicer is generally considered sturdy and well-made for harder cheeses, with stainless steel construction and good handling for medium to firm varieties. There is one mention of the slicer breaking after 3 years, but this does not seem to be a common issue. If you frequently work with soft cheeses, you may be better served by a wire slicer or a tool specifically designed for this purpose. Here are some follow-up questions you might consider: Have you considered using a wire slicer specifically designed for soft cheeses to avoid mushiness or clogging?; Would you like recommendations on techniques or additional tools for slicing softer cheeses more effectively?; Are you looking for a multipurpose slicer that works well with both soft and hard cheeses?
