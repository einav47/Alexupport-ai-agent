can i replace the cable by detaching it?

Output:
No, you cannot replace the cable by detaching it from the device. The cable is permanently attached to the headphones and is not designed to be user-replaceable. However, it is described as sturdy, with features like a thick wire and reinforced connection points to reduce the chances of damage. If the cable breaks, replacement would not be possible unless you modify or repair it yourself, which may require technical skills or disassembling the headphones. Here are some follow-up questions you might consider: Are there any precautions or tips for maintaining the integrity of the non-detachable cable to avoid damage over time?; Would you recommend a straight cable or coiled cable for different uses, such as studio recording versus general listening?; Are there alternative headphones you would suggest that come with a detachable or replaceable cable feature?
